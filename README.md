Coding challenge, back-end with Spring boot and front-end with React.
Before running the application, './mvnw.cmd clean install' for the back-end and 'npm install' for the front-end. After 'npm start' and './mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run'.
localhost:8080/app for the backend and localhost:3000 for the front.
Alternatively, instead of command line, it can be done through an IDE.
Use Chrome for testing the app.
